# Optimal Primel Algorithm

This program is meant to produce the optimal Primel algorithm.

[Primel](https://cojofra.github.io/primel/) is like Wordle but for 5 digit prime numbers.

This project is heavily inspried by the 3b1b video on [the optimal worlde stategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA),
and ~~has been~~ will hopefully be made collaboratively by high achieving students that use all their time efficiently.
